# ML From Scratch

A collection of popular Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch using only Python built-in functions and NumPy, no sklearn, no shortcuts.

## 🎯 Goal
To understand what's really happening under the hood of the models we use every day, by building them from first principles with clean, readable, and well-documented code.

## 📚 Algorithms

| Linear Regression | ✅ Done |
| Logistic Regression | ✅ Done |
| Naive Bayes | 🔜 Coming |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 🔜 Coming |
| Decision Trees | 🔜 Coming |
